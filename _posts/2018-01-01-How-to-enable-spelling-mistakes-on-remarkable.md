# About Remarkable
Remarkable is an open source software that I'm using to edit the post of this website.

If offers very nice functionality as easy insertion of tags, instant output rendering but also word spelling mistakes.

In order to have them enabled, the following package needs to be installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-gtkspellcheck
```
